APIs
1. Upload a file to Google Drive
Two types of uploads are supported:
• Simple upload. Use this upload type when the file size is small.
• Resumable upload. Use this upload type when the file size is large and there is high chance of network interruption.

Here is an example of resumable upload API:
https://api.example.com/files/upload?uploadType=resumable
Params:
• uploadType=resumable
• data: Local file to be uploaded.
 
A resumable upload is achieved by the following 3 steps [2]: 
• Send the initial request to retrieve the resumable URL.
• Upload the data and monitor upload state.
• If upload is disturbed, resume the upload.

2. Download a file from Google Drive
Example API: https://api.example.com/files/download
Params:
• path: download file path.
Example params:
{
	"path": "/recipes/soup/best_soup.txt"
}

3. Get file revisions
Example API: https://api.example.com/files/list_revisions
Params:
• path: The path to the file you want to get the revision history.
• limit: The maximum number of revisions to return.
Example params:
{
	"path": "/recipes/soup/best_soup.txt",
	"limit": 20 
}

Single server key-value store
Developing a key-value store that resides in a single server is easy. An intuitive approach is to store key-value pairs in a hash table, which keeps everything in memory. 
Even though memory access is fast, fitting everything in memory may be impossible due to the space constraint. Two optimizations can be done to fit more data in a single server:
• Data compression
• Store only frequently used data in memory and the rest on disk







• Data partition
• Data replication
• Consistency
• Inconsistency resolution
• Handling failures
• System architecture diagram • Write path
• Read path

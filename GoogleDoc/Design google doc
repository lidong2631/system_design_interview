1Ô∏è‚É£ Clients send document editing operations to the WebSocket Server.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The real-time communication is handled by the WebSocket Server.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Documents operations are persisted in the Message Queue.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The File Operation Server consumes operations produced by clients and generates transformed operations using collaboration algorithms.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Three types of data are stored: file metadata, file content, and operations. 

One of the biggest challenges is real-time conflict resolution. Common algorithms include:

üîπ Operational transformation (OT)

üîπ Differential Synchronization (DS)

üîπ Conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT)

Google Doc uses OT according to its Wikipedia page and CRDT is an active area of research for real-time concurrent editing.

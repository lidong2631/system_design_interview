Different types of notifications

iOS push notification
Provider - APNs - iOS
• Provider. A provider builds and sends notification requests to Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). To construct a push notification, the provider provides the following data:
	• Device token: This is a unique identifier used for sending push notifications.
	• Payload: This is a JSON dictionary that contains a notification’s payload
		{
			"aps": {
				"alert": {
					"title": "Game Request",
					"body": "Bob wants to play chess",
					"action-loc-key": "PLAY"
				},
				"badge": 5
			}
		}
• APNS: This is a remote service provided by Apple to propagate push notifications to iOS devices.
• iOS Device: It is the end client, which receives push notifications.

Android push notification
Provider - APNs - iOS
Instead of using APNs, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is commonly used to send push notifications to android devices.

SMS message
For SMS messages, third party SMS services like Twilio [1], Nexmo [2], and many others are commonly used. Most of them are commercial services.

Email
Although companies can set up their own email servers, many of them opt for commercial email services. Sendgrid [3] and Mailchimp [4] are among the most popular email services, 
which offer a better delivery rate and data analytics.

Contact info gathering flow
To send notifications, we need to gather mobile device tokens, phone numbers, or email addresses. when a user installs our app or signs up for the first time, API servers collect user contact info and store it in the database.
Email addresses and phone numbers are stored in the user table, whereas device tokens are stored in the device table. A user can have multiple devices, indicating that a push notification can be sent to all the user devices.
